1. Physical Entities (Continuants)
1.1 Airfoil

    Material Artifact (BFO:0000040)
        The broad category in CCO for physically made objects (e.g., engines, tools, vehicles).
        Since an airfoil is a manufactured part (e.g., a turbine blade or vane), it fits as a subclass (or instance) of Material Artifact.

ex:Airfoil rdfs:subClassOf cco:MaterialArtifact .

(If you want to further situate the airfoil under Engine → Heat Engine → Combustion Engine → Internal Combustion Engine → Gas Turbine, you could do that. But if your focus is just the blade, placing it directly under Material Artifact is simpler.)
1.2 Edge and Tip

    fiat object part (BFO:0000024)
        A “fiat” or “abstractly bounded” region of a physical object, not a separable part in its own right.
        Leading edges, trailing edges, and tips are boundaries/regions of the airfoil.

So you can define:

ex:Edge rdfs:subClassOf cco:FiatObjectPart .
ex:Tip  rdfs:subClassOf cco:FiatObjectPart .

Then create specific individuals (or subclasses) for LeadingEdge and TrailingEdge, both also under cco:FiatObjectPart.
1.3 Defect

    Often modeled as a fiat object part as well—since a “defect” is really a region of damage on the airfoil, not a separate physical object.

ex:Defect rdfs:subClassOf cco:FiatObjectPart .

You can refine further if you like:

ex:EdgeDefect rdfs:subClassOf ex:Defect .
ex:TipDefect  rdfs:subClassOf ex:Defect .

2. Processes
2.1 InspectionMethod (e.g., “scanbox”)

    process (BFO:0000015) → Act → Planned Act → Act of Measuring
        In CCO, any deliberate measurement activity can be considered an “Act of Measuring.”

You might define:

ex:InspectionMethod rdfs:subClassOf cco:ActOfMeasuring .

That way, if you create an individual ex:ScanboxInspection of type ex:InspectionMethod, it inherits from cco:ActOfMeasuring.
3. Measurements (Indices & Distances)
3.1 Measurement Values

According to CCO, numeric measurements are typically Information Content Entities in the category:

generically dependent continuant (BFO:0000031)
 └─ Information Content Entity
     └─ Descriptive Information Content Entity
        └─ Measurement Information Content Entity
           └─ Ratio Measurement Information Content Entity
              └─ Distance Measurement Information Content Entity

So you might define:

ex:IndexMeasurement
   rdfs:subClassOf cco:DistanceMeasurementInformationContentEntity .

Then you can have ex:Index1Measurement, ex:Index2Measurement, ex:Index3Measurement, etc., all under cco:DistanceMeasurementInformationContentEntity. The same goes for Depth and Length, which are also distances:

ex:DepthMeasurement  rdfs:subClassOf cco:DistanceMeasurementInformationContentEntity .
ex:LengthMeasurement rdfs:subClassOf cco:DistanceMeasurementInformationContentEntity .

Alternatively—and more simply—if you just want to store the numeric distance as a data property on the Defect instance, you can skip making classes for each measurement. But if you do want to follow CCO’s pattern strictly, giving each measurement its own individual is more aligned with “Information Content Entities.”
4. Rules or “Template Describing Airfoil Defects”

OWL itself cannot directly encode your “If chordwise < 0.080, measure index 3 from leading edge” logic. In CCO/BFO, instructions or constraints typically fall under:

generically dependent continuant (BFO:0000031)
 └─ Information Content Entity
     └─ Directive Information Content Entity
         └─ Algorithm
         (or Plan, or Action Requirement)

So you could have:

ex:DefectMeasurementRule
   rdfs:subClassOf cco:Algorithm .

Or:

ex:DefectMeasurementRule
   rdfs:subClassOf cco:ActionRequirement .

Any of these “directive” classes would be used to store or reference the rules (in SWRL, SHACL, or external logic). For instance, you could keep them as text, or attach your SWRL statements as annotations, etc.
5. Putting It All Together

Here’s a concise summary of the minimal classes mapped onto CCO:

    Airfoil
        rdfs:subClassOf cco:MaterialArtifact.

    Edge, Tip
        rdfs:subClassOf cco:FiatObjectPart.

    Defect
        rdfs:subClassOf cco:FiatObjectPart.
        (Optional) specialized as ex:EdgeDefect, ex:TipDefect.

    InspectionMethod
        rdfs:subClassOf cco:ActOfMeasuring.

    Measurement Entities (Indices, Depth, Length)
        rdfs:subClassOf cco:DistanceMeasurementInformationContentEntity.
        e.g., ex:Index1Measurement, ex:DepthMeasurement, etc.

    Rules
        rdfs:subClassOf cco:Algorithm (or cco:ActionRequirement, or cco:Plan).

Example in Turtle

@prefix cco: <http://www.ontologyrepository.com/CCO_> .
@prefix ex:  <http://example.com/airfoil#> .

ex:Airfoil rdfs:subClassOf cco:MaterialArtifact .
ex:Defect  rdfs:subClassOf cco:FiatObjectPart .
ex:Edge    rdfs:subClassOf cco:FiatObjectPart .
ex:Tip     rdfs:subClassOf cco:FiatObjectPart .

ex:InspectionMethod rdfs:subClassOf cco:ActOfMeasuring .

ex:Index1Measurement rdfs:subClassOf cco:DistanceMeasurementInformationContentEntity .
ex:DepthMeasurement  rdfs:subClassOf cco:DistanceMeasurementInformationContentEntity .

ex:DefectMeasurementRule rdfs:subClassOf cco:Algorithm .

This anchors your custom classes in the CCO hierarchy. From here, you can add properties (object/data) and possibly SWRL/SHACL rules to handle “If chordwise < 0.080, then measure from leading edge,” etc.

That’s the basic alignment needed to ensure your airfoil/defect data and rules are placed where they belong within the CCO structure.
