==================

Two Complementary Ontologies

    Supply Chain Ontology (~30 classes)

    Analytics Ontology (~280 classes)

Broad Coverage and Detailed Structure

    Supply Chain Ontology provides a focused, concise model (e.g., logistics, inventory, sourcing).

    Analytics Ontology captures a wider scope with more granular classes (covering various analytical methods, data processing steps, and metrics).

Reusable Building Blocks

    Common concepts (e.g., “Supplier,” “Order,” “KPI,” “DataPoint”) can be leveraged across different projects.

    Standardized relationships ensure consistent understanding and interoperability among teams.

Facilitates Interoperability

    Shared definitions ease integration with other ontologies or data models (e.g., enterprise frameworks, industry standards).

    Enables seamless data exchange and reporting across systems.

Scalable and Adaptable

    The compact size of the Supply Chain Ontology makes it easy to grasp and extend for specific workflows.

    The larger Analytics Ontology serves as a robust foundation for advanced and specialized analytical tasks.

Accelerates Implementation and Analysis

    Clearly defined classes and relations reduce setup time for new use cases.

    Encourages best practices for data governance and analytics processes.
