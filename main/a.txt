Overarching Goal: Position REO as a fundamental enabler for the DGO to achieve its mission of high-quality, discoverable, standardized, and compliant data. Frame REO not as another standard, but as the semantic glue that makes their existing standards and processes more effective.

Your Approach:

    Acknowledge & Align: Start by acknowledging their mission and showing you understand their challenges (poor quality costs, source of truth, enabling analytics – use their "Why care?" points).

    Introduce REO Briefly: Explain REO (Reference Enterprise Ontology based on BFO/CCO) as the enterprise standard for meaning and relationships between key concepts.

    Connect REO to DGO Goals: Explicitly map how REO helps them achieve their specific objectives (see synergy points below).

    Propose Concrete Partnership Actions: Make specific, actionable requests tied to their functions and tools.

    Request Representation: Reiterate the need for their participation in the Ontology Governance Committee (OGC).

Specific Asks Targeted at DGO Functions:

Here’s what you can ask for, categorized by the relevant DGO teams/functions :

1. Ask from: Business Ops - Strategy & Organization / Policies, Processes & Standards

    The Ask: "Can we work with your team to formally recognize REO within the ENTERPRISE Data Governance Strategy and Policies as the designated standard for semantic definition and interoperability?"

    Why it Helps Them: Provides a concrete mechanism (REO) to enforce semantic consistency, directly supporting their goal of standardized practices and reducing ambiguity in policies. Aligns with "architecting the data governance strategy or framework".

    The Ask: "We request your support in integrating REO alignment into the operational procedures for defining Critical Data Elements (CDEs) and managing Data Domains."

    Why it Helps Them: Ensures the most critical data is defined unambiguously using a common standard (REO), improving quality and consistency (answering "Is the data high quality?"). Helps structure Data Domains semantically.

    The Ask: "Could REO be incorporated into the Taxonomy management process, ensuring alignment between enterprise taxonomies and the formal ontology?"

    Why it Helps Them: Creates a more robust and logically sound structure for classification and discovery, connecting informal taxonomies to formal semantics.

2. Ask from: DG Ops - Data Management (Metadata, MDM)

    The Ask: "We propose a joint effort to integrate REO with the ENTERPRISE Data Catalog. Specifically, enabling the linking of Business Glossary terms and technical metadata (tables, columns) to REO concepts."

    Why it Helps Them: Directly enhances the Data Catalog's value by adding a semantic layer. Improves data discoverability ("Can we find the data we need?"), understanding, and trust. Supports their Metadata Management function. Makes the Business Glossary more rigorous and standardized.

    The Ask: "Can we collaborate on leveraging REO as the conceptual model underpinning definitions within the Master Data Management (MDM) program?"

    Why it Helps Them: Provides a clear, enterprise-agreed semantic foundation for defining master data entities, reducing integration issues and improving the establishment of a "source of truth".

3. Ask from: DG Ops - Data Quality

    The Ask: "We request your guidance on incorporating semantic consistency checks, based on REO definitions and relationships, into the ENTERPRISE Data Quality Strategy and Quality Scorecards."

    Why it Helps Them: Moves beyond syntactic/structural quality checks to address semantic quality (does the data mean the right thing?). Provides richer proactive monitoring and reports on data meaning. Directly addresses their "Quality Scorecards" and "DQ Strategy" responsibilities.

    The Ask: "Can REO definitions be used to provide precise specifications when defining Data Quality Rules?"

    Why it Helps Them: Makes DQ rules less ambiguous and more effective, leading to higher quality data ("Is the data high quality?").

4. Ask from: DG Ops - Data Compliance

    The Ask: "Can we explore using REO concepts to standardize the definitions used in Data Classifications & Tagging and for defining Access Control rules?"

    Why it Helps Them: Brings clarity and consistency to how data is categorized for compliance and security purposes, reducing risk and ambiguity in policy enforcement. Supports "Control policies & access control".

5. Ask from: DG Ops - User Engagement & Support

    The Ask: "We request collaboration to include foundational ontology concepts and the purpose/value of REO within your Data Literacy program and training materials."

    Why it Helps Them: Increases enterprise-wide understanding of semantic standards, fostering better data practices and supporting their Socialization & Change Management efforts.

    The Ask: "Can we utilize your established stakeholder engagement channels to communicate the value of REO and share success stories?"

    Why it Helps Them: Leverages their communication infrastructure to promote a key data governance enabler (REO), improving adoption and demonstrating the value of the overall data program.

6. Ask from: DG Ops - Tooling Capabilities

    The Ask: "As you manage the roadmaps for the ENTERPRISE Data Catalog and Data Quality tools, can we ensure that features supporting REO integration (e.g., linking, semantic search, visualization) are considered and prioritized?"

    Why it Helps Them: Ensures their core tooling investments are enhanced by, and work synergistically with, the enterprise semantic standard (REO).

The Role of the DGO Representative in the OGC:

When asking them to join the OGC, explicitly state what you expect their role to be, leveraging their expertise:

    "Ensure proposed ontology changes align with overall Data Governance Strategy, Policies, and Standards."

    "Provide guidance on the practical implementation and enforceability of ontology standards within DGO processes (e.g., Catalog, DQ, MDM)."

    "Champion REO within DGO forums and ensure DGO tooling roadmaps consider REO integration needs."

    "Act as a bridge, bringing DGO requirements (e.g., definitions needed for CDEs, compliance categories) to the OGC."

    "Facilitate communication and alignment between the OGC and relevant DGO functions."

In Summary:

You have a well-defined DGO with clear responsibilities. Approach them as partners, showing how REO directly helps them achieve their stated mission and operational goals, particularly around standardization, quality, discoverability, MDM, and the data catalog. Frame your requests around specific DGO functions and tools, demonstrating you understand their world. This targeted approach significantly increases your chances of building an effective partnership and gaining their crucial support for REO adoption.
