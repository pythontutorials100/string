Participation in the OAGi Summit delivered vital intelligence for RTX's digital and interoperability goals. The summit confirmed widespread industry adoption of semantic technologies, with key players (Airbus, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, BAE, NASA, DHS, DLA) implementing foundational (BFO) and mid-level (CCO, IOF) ontologiesâ€”validating RTX's strategic direction. This understanding of the competitive landscape sharpens our benchmarking, collaboration strategies, and foresight in digital thread, digital twins, and supply chain resilience. We secured valuable ontology modeling patterns and standards insights, now being integrated to accelerate RTX development and ensure robust, best-practice solutions. Direct customer interactions addressed current challenges and uncovered follow-on work, while engagements with potential customers highlighted their needs, enabling us to refine offerings and pinpoint new business opportunities.
