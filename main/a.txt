Use of Description Logics in Protégé:

    Protégé, the ontology editor we use, is designed to work with Web Ontology Language (OWL), which is based on description logics—a subset of first-order logic.
    When we model ontologies in Protégé, we are effectively employing description logics to define classes, properties, and their interrelations.

The ontologies we develop using Protégé and based on BFO and CCO are encoded in OWL, which has semantics grounded in first-order logic.
The reasoning tasks—such as consistency checking, classification, and inferencing—are performed within a logical framework that adheres to FOL semantics.
