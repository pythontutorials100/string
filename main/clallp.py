Story 1: BU Ontology Development – Scoping & Requirements

    Description
    Conduct initial scoping sessions with the business unit to define ontology requirements, identify key entities and relationships, and determine the high-level use cases that the ontology should support.

    Acceptance Criteria

        Requirements Document created, outlining key domains, stakeholders, and intended ontology use cases.

        Sign-Off from the BU sponsor or product owner, confirming the documented scope matches their needs.

Story 2: Skills Ontology – Definition & Query Prototypes

    Description
    Define a preliminary Skills Ontology to capture relevant skills/taxonomies (e.g., engineering skills, domain-specific expertise), and create a set of sample SPARQL or graph queries to validate structure and relationships.

    Acceptance Criteria

        Ontology Schema drafted (classes, properties, example individuals) in a recognized format (e.g., OWL).

        At Least Two Working Queries demonstrating how stakeholders can retrieve skill-related data (e.g., “find all employees with skill X in business unit Y”).

Story 3: PWC DPHM Ontology – IDWA (SOW) Alignment

    Description
    Align the PWC Digital Predictive Health Maintenance (DPHM) Ontology with the IDWA Statement of Work requirements. Ensure that all SOW-dictated entities, data flows, and business rules are accurately represented in the ontology.

    Acceptance Criteria

        Ontology Mapping Document that traces each IDWA SOW requirement to relevant classes/properties in the PWC DPHM Ontology.

        Stakeholder Review completed with PWC, capturing any updates needed before finalizing the Q2 deliverable.

Story 4: PW AFRL Knowledge Graph – Follow-On Support

    Description
    Provide ongoing ontology and knowledge graph enhancements for the PW AFRL project, addressing feedback from the Q1 delivery. Update the knowledge model, define new relationships, and refine queries as requested.

    Acceptance Criteria

        Updated Ontology/Graph Model reflecting at least two requested enhancements (e.g., new classes, added data properties) based on Q1 feedback.

        Demonstration Session held with PW AFRL stakeholders, showing how the revised knowledge graph meets the updated requirements.
