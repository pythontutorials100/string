Our participation in the recent OAGi Summit provided critical intelligence that directly supports RTX's strategic objectives in digital transformation and data interoperability. The summit confirmed a strong industry-wide momentum towards adopting semantic technologies, with key players like Airbus, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, BAE, NASA, DHS and the DLA actively implementing foundational (e.g., BFO) and mid-level (e.g., CCO, IOF) ontologiesâ€”standards RTX is also strategically adopting.
We gained a clearer understanding of where competitors and partners stand in their semantic technology adoption. This allows us to benchmark our progress, identify collaborative opportunities, and anticipate industry shifts.
We've acquired valuable ontology modeling patterns and insights into emerging standards and methodologies. These resources are being integrated to accelerate our internal development, improve the robustness of our semantic solutions.
At the summit, direct interactions with existing customers like DHS allowed us to address their current challenges and identify concrete opportunities for follow-on work. Engagements with potential customers provided firsthand knowledge of their pressing issues, enabling us to better tailor RTX's offerings and pinpoint new avenues for business development.
