Slide 1: Proposed Research Thrust: Physics-Informed Ontological Reasoning for Heterogeneous Systems

(Addressing MURI Topic 10: Ontology Engineering for Machine Learning in Open-ended Sensor, Model, User Systems)

Alignment with MURI Objective: Our proposed research directly targets the MURI Topic 10 objective: "Create a flexible machine learning framework for embedding data, processes, models, and representations into a shared ontology for principled modeling and efficient communication under complex constraints."

Our Core Proposed Idea (Developed in collaboration with Dr. JP): To develop an ontological framework that not only integrates heterogeneous sensor data but crucially incorporates physics-based reasoning and simulation capabilities, overcoming the limitations of current ontology reasoners for dynamic, continuous systems.

Key Proposed Research Areas:

    Ontologizing Heterogeneous Sensor Data for Physics-Based Analysis:

        Challenge Tackled: Integrating diverse sensor inputs (e.g., video, radar) capturing physical phenomena (e.g., movement) where current methods fail due to modality/distribution differences (as highlighted in MURI Background).

        Our Approach:

            Develop novel semantic grounding techniques (relates to MURI Area 1) mapping sensor data to domain ontologies capturing spatio-temporal and physical properties (e.g., mass, velocity, constraints).

            Utilize the resulting ontology for cross-sensor, physics-informed analysis (e.g., consistent gait analysis, trajectory prediction respecting kinematics).

            Illustrative Scenario: Tracking an individual via ontological reasoning about physically plausible motion across sparse, heterogeneous camera views, enhancing robustness beyond appearance alone.

        MURI Relevance: Addresses Areas (1) Semantic grounding, (2) Embedding domain ontologies, and (4) requiring new ML algorithms operating within this physics-aware ontological space.

    Bridging Ontological Reasoning and Physics Solvers:

        Challenge Tackled: The inability of standard ontology reasoners (FOL, DL) to handle continuous dynamics described by differential equations, which are essential for physics-based prediction and understanding (a gap implicit in the call for a flexible framework).

        Our Approach:

            Design formalisms to represent physical laws and system dynamics (e.g., differential equations) within or linked to the ontological structure.

            Create mechanisms to couple external physics solvers/simulators with the ontology reasoner, enabling hybrid reasoning.

            Develop query capabilities that leverage physical simulation (e.g., "Predict the state of System Y after time T given initial ontological state and known physical laws").

        MURI Relevance: Directly advances the core Objective for a more flexible and principled modeling framework, significantly extending Area (5) Characterizing ontology components/properties and likely Area (4) with ML methods bridging symbolic and numerical computation.

Expected Outcome: A unique ML-Ontology framework enabling deeper situational understanding and prediction in complex, open-ended systems by rigorously integrating semantic representation with quantitative physical modeling, directly addressing the needs outlined in MURI Topic 10.

Slide 2: Understanding the Core Challenge of MURI Topic 10

(Based on the Solicitation Text from Dr. John S. Hyatt, ARL)

The Central Problem Identified in the MURI Solicitation:

Systemic Fragmentation & Lack of Semantic Interoperability in Modern Distributed, Heterogeneous Systems.

Breakdown of the Challenge (as described in the MURI text):

    Heterogeneity Barrier: Current systems (like Federated Learning variants) struggle immensely when components (nodes, sensors, models) operate with:

        Different data modalities (e.g., video vs. radar vs. text).

        Data from different underlying distributions.

        Requiring costly, slow, and error-prone "translation" layers.

    Communication & Representation Deficiencies:

        Communication is often limited, inefficient, and uses arbitrary formats.

        Internal ML model representations are typically opaque, model-specific, and lack shared meaning ("poor semantic grounding").

        There's no common ground for diverse components to share complex information effectively.

    Inability to Handle Open-endedness: Systems are brittle when faced with incorporating new, previously unseen data types or sensor modalities.

    Lack of a Unifying Framework: The solicitation highlights the absence of a principled way to:

        Understand relationships between highly diverse representations.

        Ground distinct models and data types in a shared conceptual space.

        Optimize systems across multiple complex criteria (utility, robustness, etc.).

        Enable reasoning analogous to human "mental models" that integrate diverse information sources based on underlying principles (causality, physics, logic).

Consequences Outlined: High costs (power, time, bandwidth), slow system response/adaptation, inability to perform complex cross-modal reasoning, difficulty optimizing systems holistically, and lack of robustness.

MURI Topic 10's Goal: To directly address this fundamental gap by funding research into an Ontology-centric Machine Learning framework designed to provide the necessary semantic foundation for interoperability, principled modeling, and efficient communication in these complex, open-ended systems.
