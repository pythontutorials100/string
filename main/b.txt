Orientation on Ontology & Knowledge Graph Capabilities at [Your Company]

Hi [Name],

I’m part of the team working on semantic technologies at [Your Company], with a focus on ontology development, formal logic, and inferencing using standards-based approaches. We support teams across business units in modeling domain knowledge, building knowledge graphs, and writing complex queries that drive insights and integration.

We also maintain the company’s Enterprise Ontology, built on ISO standards, which serves as a foundation for consistent, interoperable data modeling.

I’m reaching out to connect with teams working on data analytics, AI, or data integration initiatives. We’re hosting a short 30-minute orientation to introduce our current capabilities, share examples of how we’ve helped other teams, and explore how we might support your efforts.

Would you be interested in joining?

Best regards,
