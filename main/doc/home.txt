📌 Slide 2: Objectives
Project Goals

    Establish Decision Support Questions (DSQs) to formalize airfoil repair assessments.
    Develop an ontology framework to represent airfoil distress and repair decisions.
    Provide training to align stakeholders on DSQ methodology & ontology development.
    Deliver a foundational knowledge graph to support future repair automation & data interoperability.

Business Impact

✅ Standardized DSQ methodology for airfoil assessment
✅ Structured, computable ontology for repair decision-making
✅ Increased data interoperability across aftermarket programs
✅ Supports VAULTIS implementation & enterprise digital thread
📌 Slide 3: High‐Level Approach
Phase 1: DSQ Definition

🔹 Training on DSQ Process (Why DSQs? How do they guide decision-making?)
🔹 Workshops to identify & align DSQs for airfoil repair
🔹 Refinement of DSQs to ensure completeness and relevance
🔹 Documentation of DSQs for ontology integration
Phase 2: Ontology Development

🔹 Training on Ontology Development Process (Ontology structure, best practices)
🔹 Define Initial Ontology Classes & Relationships (Airfoil, Distress, Repair, etc.)
🔹 Establish Business Rules (E.g., “If depth > threshold, repair not feasible”)
🔹 Load Initial Ontology into Knowledge Graph (Stardog or another KG platform)
📌 Slide 4: Timeline & Key Milestones
📆 Phase 1: DSQ Definition (Weeks 1–4)

    Week 1: Training on DSQ methodology
    Week 2: DSQ workshops with stakeholders
    Week 3: DSQ refinement based on feedback
    Week 4: DSQ documentation finalized

🎯 Milestone 1: DSQ documentation completed
📆 Phase 2: Ontology Development (Weeks 5–10)

    Week 5: Training on ontology development
    Week 6: Define initial ontology classes & relationships
    Week 7: Define initial ontology business rules
    Week 8: Load ontology into KG
    Week 9–10: Internal validation, final refinements

🎯 Milestone 2: Basic ontology structure completed & loaded
📌 Slide 5: Key Deliverables

✅ Training on DSQ Process (Week 1–2)
✅ DSQ Workshops & Alignment (Week 2–3)
✅ Training on Ontology Development (Week 5)
✅ Initial Ontology Classes & Relationships (Week 6–7)
✅ Ontology Business Rules Defined & Loaded (Week 8–10)

📌 Final output: A structured, queryable ontology supporting airfoil repair decision-making
📌 Slide 6: Next Steps

1️⃣ Schedule DSQ training sessions (Week 1)
2️⃣ Set up DSQ workshops with SMEs (Week 2)
3️⃣ Finalize DSQs & align with repair workflows (Week 4)
4️⃣ Start ontology development phase (Week 5)
5️⃣ Load & test ontology in Stardog or KG platform (Week 8–10)
