    Q&A / Next Steps
        Quick preview of deeper dive in the next session

Slide: Todayâ€™s Focus

    Bridge Knowledge Gaps: Introduce ontology and knowledge graph concepts 
    Highlight Real-World Relevance: Show how these concepts drive efficiency and insights in projects
    Engage with Foundational Skills: Begin understanding competency questions to shape ontology design

Slide: Outcomes

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

    Identify the purpose and value of ontologies and knowledge graphs in an engineering context.
    Recognize how they can be applied to real-life scenarios 
    Understand the high-level steps of developing an ontology (from initial scoping to implementation).
    Explain the role of competency questions in guiding ontology structure and scope.
    Prepare to formulate relevant competency questions for your own engineering projects in the next session.
