=====

Refine the Scope: Confirm specific sensor modalities, scenario use-cases (e.g., object detection from UAV imagery, cross-analysis of textual intelligence with radar tracks, etc.) in consultation with Army TPOCs.

Solidify Team: Identify academic subawardees or internal collaborators for specialized tasks (e.g., top-level ontology design, advanced optimization algorithms).

White Paper: Prepare a concise version of this proposal for initial submission if the solicitation process recommends a white paper.

Budget and Resources: Outline staffing, student/postdoc support (if university partners are involved), software/hardware infrastructure (GPUs for ML training, HPC cluster, data storage).

Engage with Program Managers: Validate alignment with MURI/BAA objectives, clarify any special interest areas, confirm funding mechanics.
