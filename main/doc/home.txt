Develop a foundational engagement approach (including an updated deck, live demos, or white papers) by Q2 that highlights the value and ROI of our ontology solutions, and actively pursue opportunities (e.g., external workshops, standard-committee panels, or partner roundtables) through Q4 to raise awareness and adoption.

Contribute to T&GE SharePoint by creating and curating tailored ontology training materials (videos, documentation) that build upon BFO and REO principles, and support at least one internal knowledge-sharing session or workshop each quarter, to ensure a broad base of informed stakeholders by Q4.
