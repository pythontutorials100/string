Subject: REO Turtle File Formatting Issue in Ohub

Hi [Name],

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to bring to your attention an issue I noticed with our REO ontology file after uploading it to Ontology Hub (Ohub) and then downloading it again in Turtle format.

Originally, our Turtle file has a well-defined structure:

    Prefixes at the top
    Ontology metadata (authors, version, etc.)
    Annotation properties
    Object properties
    Classes
    Well-placed comments

However, once I re-downloaded the file from Ohub, its structure was significantly altered:

    All comments in the code are missing.
    Prefixes are repeatedly declared for individual entities, making the file less readable.
    Axioms defined using owl:intersectionOf, owl:unionOf, etc., are transformed into less human-readable forms with generated identifiers.

In Protégé, the contents still appear correct—so in terms of ontology data integrity, there’s no immediate functional issue. But the readability and clear structure of the code are lost, which could cause confusion or potential issues if we work with certain knowledge graph tools.

I’m attaching both the original REO Turtle file and the transformed version, along with some snapshots to illustrate the differences. I’m planning to test the transformed code on a knowledge graph tool to see if there are any unforeseen impacts, and I’ll keep you posted on my findings.

If you have any thoughts or suggestions on maintaining the original format (including comments and structure) while using Ohub, I would really appreciate your input.
