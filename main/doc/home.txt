3. Why Ontology Governance Matters
3.1 Consistency & Reliability

    Enterprise Alignment: Keeps domain ontologies (MRO, DPHM, etc.) consistently aligned with REO (based on BFO/CCO).
    Standards Compliance: BFO is ISO-certified; CCO is on track. Ensures REO remains compatible with evolving standards.
    Minimize Duplication: Avoid conflicting definitions, reduce rework.

3.2 Collaboration

    Cross-Team Engagement: Clear governance procedures break down development silos.
    Ownership & Transparency: Everyone knows how to propose changes, who reviews them, and how approval is granted.

3.3 Quality & Scalability

    Formal Reviews: Reduce semantic errors and ensure logical coherence.
    Stable Growth: Governance provides guardrails for scaling ontology usage across the enterprise.
