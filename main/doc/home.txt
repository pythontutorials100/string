I’ve reviewed the agenda for the 2025 Industrial Digital Ecosystem Summit, and it features several sessions directly relevant to our Ontology and Knowledge Graph Center of Excellence. Specifically:

    Knowledge Graph and AI Keynote (Day 1) and multiple talks on ontology applications in industry (e.g., Airbus, TotalEnergies)
    Ontology in Enterprise Integration and Digital Thread/Digital Twin discussions, which align with our aerospace focus
    Aerospace Industry Roundtable on the final day, with Airbus, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing sharing use cases and visions relevant to our domain

These sessions look valuable for networking, benchmarking, and staying current on best practices around industrial ontologies, knowledge graphs, and digital threads. I recommend we attend to strengthen our expertise and contribute our perspective as an aerospace manufacturer.

Please let me know if you’d like me to register or need any other details.

==========

Based on the agenda, a few sessions may be relevant to our work:

1. Knowledge Graph and AI Keynote (April 8) – NSF Proto-OKN Project could offer insights into broader AI-driven knowledge graph applications.


2. Use of IOF Ontology (April 8) – Airbus’ integration of design and simulation via IOF-driven Semantic Hub aligns with our digital thread and ontology initiatives.


3. Ontology and AI (April 8) – ManTech’s use of an ontologically-backed digital thread for portfolio analysis may provide useful methodologies.


4. IOF Architecture WG Meeting (April 9) – Covers ontology development governance, which could inform our best practices.


5. IOF Core/CCO Mapping Workshop (April 11) – Discusses the relationship between CCO and IOF, which may align with our ongoing ontology integration work.


6. Aerospace Industry Roundtable (April 11) – Airbus, Lockheed, and Boeing will discuss ontology use in aerospace, making it a key networking and learning opportunity.



Let me know if you’d like me to attend or gather insights from any of these.

Best,
Shatad
