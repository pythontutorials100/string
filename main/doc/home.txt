Below is a *starter* ontology outline (with illustrative OWL/Turtle syntax) showing how you can incorporate BFO and CCO, while modeling airfoil‐defect data and the measurement indices you described. This is *not* a final or exhaustive ontology. Instead, it demonstrates a structural approach that you can refine and extend. Feel free to adapt class/property names to align with your internal naming conventions or the exact IRIs you adopt.

---

## 1. Namespaces & Prefixes

You’ll need appropriate prefixes for:
- **BFO**  
- **CCO**  
- **Your Ontology** (example: `ex:` or a more specific base URI)

For example:

```turtle
@prefix rdf:   <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs:  <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix owl:   <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix xsd:   <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

@prefix bfo:   <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_> .      # hypothetical BFO
@prefix cco:   <http://www.ontologyrepository.com/CCO_> .  # hypothetical CCO
@prefix ex:    <http://example.com/airfoil-defect#> .       # your domain ontology
```

*(Note: Replace the actual URIs for BFO/CCO with the official ones you use.)*

## 2. Top-Level Ontology Declarations

We often begin by declaring this file as an OWL ontology:

```turtle
ex:AirfoilOntology rdf:type owl:Ontology .
```

---

## 3. High-Level Classes

Below are some domain classes and how they might relate to BFO/CCO. The key idea is that:
- An *Airfoil* is a **CCO:Artifact**.  
- *Edges* and *Tips* can be **CCO:Features** (physically part of the airfoil).  
- A *Defect* is also a **CCO:Feature** (it inheres in an artifact or feature).  
- Measurements are typically **Information Content Entities** (ICE) or **Measurement Information Bearing Entities** in CCO.

### 3.1 Airfoil, Edge, Tip

```turtle
###
# Airfoil
###
ex:Airfoil
    rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf cco:Artifact ;
    rdfs:label "Airfoil" ;
    rdfs:comment "Represents the airfoil component of a turbine blade or vane." .

###
# Edge (Generic)
###
ex:Edge
    rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf cco:Feature ;
    rdfs:label "Edge" ;
    rdfs:comment "Generic edge feature on an airfoil (leading edge, trailing edge, etc.)." .

ex:LeadingEdge
    rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf ex:Edge ;
    rdfs:label "LeadingEdge" ;
    rdfs:comment "Leading edge of the airfoil." .

ex:TrailingEdge
    rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf ex:Edge ;
    rdfs:label "TrailingEdge" ;
    rdfs:comment "Trailing edge of the airfoil." .

###
# Tip
###
ex:Tip
    rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf cco:Feature ;
    rdfs:label "Tip" ;
    rdfs:comment "Tip region of the airfoil." .
```

### 3.2 Defect

```turtle
ex:Defect
    rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf cco:Feature ;
    rdfs:label "Defect" ;
    rdfs:comment "A defect occurring on an airfoil (e.g., leading-edge crack, tip damage, etc.)." .
```

### 3.3 Measurements & Indices

Measurements are often modeled as **information content entities** that describe quantitative data about some feature. Here’s a simple approach:

```turtle
ex:Measurement
    rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf cco:MeasurementInformationBearingEntity ;
    rdfs:label "Measurement" ;
    rdfs:comment "A measurement associated with a defect, e.g. distance or depth." .

ex:DistanceMeasurement
    rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf ex:Measurement ;
    rdfs:label "DistanceMeasurement" ;
    rdfs:comment "Represents a distance from a reference (tip, leading edge, etc.)." .

ex:DepthMeasurement
    rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf ex:Measurement ;
    rdfs:label "DepthMeasurement" ;
    rdfs:comment "Represents the depth of a defect." .
```

Optionally, you could create classes for “Index1Measurement,” “Index2Measurement,” “Index3Measurement,” or simply use object properties/data properties to note “index = 1,” “index = 2,” etc. For example:

```turtle
ex:IndexMeasurement
    rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf ex:DistanceMeasurement ;
    rdfs:label "IndexMeasurement" ;
    rdfs:comment "A special type of distance measurement representing one of the defect location indices." .
```

Then you could add individuals like `ex:Index1`, `ex:Index2`, or store them as data property values. Many modeling patterns are possible here.

---

## 4. Object Properties

Next, define relationships between these classes. For instance:

1. **hasPart**: an airfoil *hasPart* an edge or tip.  
2. **hasDefect** or **bearerOfDefect**: an airfoil or edge can have a defect.  
3. **hasMeasurement**: a defect has one or more measurement(s).

```turtle
###
# hasPart
###
ex:hasPart
    rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain cco:Artifact ;     # e.g., an Airfoil
    rdfs:range cco:Feature ;       # e.g., an Edge or Tip
    rdfs:label "has part" ;
    rdfs:comment "Relates an artifact (airfoil) to its features (edges, tips, etc.)." .

###
# hasDefect
###
ex:hasDefect
    rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain cco:Feature ;  # or cco:Artifact if you want to attach defects directly to the airfoil as well
    rdfs:range ex:Defect ;
    rdfs:label "has defect" ;
    rdfs:comment "Indicates that a feature or artifact has a defect." .

###
# hasMeasurement
###
ex:hasMeasurement
    rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain ex:Defect ;        # or cco:Feature if you want to measure features in general
    rdfs:range ex:Measurement ;
    rdfs:label "has measurement" ;
    rdfs:comment "Associates a defect with its measurement entities." .
```

*(Adjust `domain` and `range` if you prefer to attach defects or measurements differently.)*

---

## 5. Data Properties

You likely need numeric values (like distance or depth). You could store these directly on the defect or on a measurement individual. For example:

```turtle
ex:hasValue
    rdf:type owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:domain ex:Measurement ;
    rdfs:range xsd:float ;
    rdfs:label "has value" ;
    rdfs:comment "Stores the numeric measurement value (e.g., 0.16, 0.408, etc.)." .
```

You might also want properties like:

- `ex:unitOfMeasurement` (string or link to a unit ontology)  
- `ex:hasIndexNumber` (e.g., 1, 2, or 3 if you explicitly store them as data)

For instance:

```turtle
ex:hasIndexNumber
    rdf:type owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:domain ex:Measurement ;
    rdfs:range xsd:integer ;
    rdfs:label "has index number" ;
    rdfs:comment "Stores the index for a distance measurement (1, 2, or 3)." .
```

---

## 6. Example Individuals

Finally, show how your CSV data might map to individuals. For instance, let’s say you have one particular airfoil with ID=1 and a leading-edge defect with certain measurement values:

```turtle
###
# Airfoil Individual
###
ex:Airfoil_1
    rdf:type ex:Airfoil ;
    rdfs:label "Airfoil #1" .

###
# Leading Edge Individual
###
ex:Airfoil_1_LeadingEdge
    rdf:type ex:LeadingEdge ;
    rdfs:label "Leading Edge of Airfoil #1" ;
    ex:hasDefect ex:Defect_1 .  # referencing the defect below

ex:Airfoil_1
    ex:hasPart ex:Airfoil_1_LeadingEdge .

###
# Defect Individual
###
ex:Defect_1
    rdf:type ex:Defect ;
    rdfs:label "Defect #1 on Leading Edge of Airfoil #1" ;
    ex:hasMeasurement ex:Measurement_1Index ;
    ex:hasMeasurement ex:Measurement_2Index ;
    ex:hasMeasurement ex:Measurement_3Index ;
    ex:hasMeasurement ex:DepthMeasurement_1 .

###
# Measurements (Index1, Index2, Index3, Depth)
###
ex:Measurement_1Index
    rdf:type ex:IndexMeasurement ;
    ex:hasValue "0.16"^^xsd:float ;
    ex:hasIndexNumber 1 .

ex:Measurement_2Index
    rdf:type ex:IndexMeasurement ;
    ex:hasValue "0.408"^^xsd:float ;
    ex:hasIndexNumber 2 .

ex:Measurement_3Index
    rdf:type ex:IndexMeasurement ;
    ex:hasValue "0.092"^^xsd:float ;
    ex:hasIndexNumber 3 .

ex:DepthMeasurement_1
    rdf:type ex:DepthMeasurement ;
    ex:hasValue "0.249"^^xsd:float .
```

*(This corresponds roughly to the first row in your data: 0.16, 0.408, 0.092, 0.249 for Index1, Index2, Index3, Depth/Length, etc.)*

You can continue adding individuals for each row in your CSV. Then, a script or ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process can generate these individuals automatically and load them into your triple store (Stardog).

---

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Refine Classes & Properties**:  
   - Decide whether to keep `Index1`, `Index2`, `Index3` as separate classes or simply store them as a data property on each measurement.  
   - Confirm if you need more geometry classes (e.g., `Platform`, `Surface`, “ShortestDistanceFromPlatform,” etc.).  
2. **Integrate BFO/CCO Properly**:  
   - Make sure your IRIs match the official BFO and CCO references.  
   - Align your classes with their recommended top-level classes.  
3. **Rules / Constraints**:  
   - You can add OWL restrictions, e.g. “An Airfoil must have at least one LeadingEdge and one TrailingEdge.”  
   - You can specify cardinalities, e.g. “A Defect must have exactly 1 DepthMeasurement,” etc.  
4. **Load & Test in Stardog**:  
   - Create your ontology in Protégé (or another editor).  
   - Export as an OWL file, load it into Stardog.  
   - Transform your CSV defect data into RDF individuals.  
   - Check that SPARQL queries can retrieve the correct relationships.

---

### In Summary

This example ontology provides a *conceptual foundation* using BFO/CCO for:

- **Airfoil** and its **Feature** parts (leading edge, trailing edge, tip).  
- **Defect** as a feature inhering in the airfoil.  
- **Measurements** for distance, depth, and indexing.  

By extending it, adding constraints, and systematically converting your CSV data into individuals, you’ll have a knowledge graph ready for querying and for integration with your CAD tool.
