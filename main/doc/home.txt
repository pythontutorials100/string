Below is a concise, high-quality set of slide-ready content focused on the DSQ Template columns. It ties in market segmentation/beachhead concepts under Stakeholders, highlights key elements for each column, and explains the importance of genus–species definitions in ontology. You can adapt or expand these points to fit your specific presentation style.

## Slide: DSQ Template – Overview
**Columns:**  
1. **# (Identifier)**  
2. **Stakeholders**  
3. **Objectives**  
4. **Competency**  
5. **Decision**  
6. **Decision Support Question (DSQ)**  
7. **Potential Classes**  
8. **Potential Data Sources**  
9. **Class Categorization**  
10. **Genus–Species Definition**  
11. **Object Properties**

These columns provide a structured way to capture each DSQ and the ontology requirements it implies.

---

## Slide: # (Identifier)
- A simple numeric or alphanumeric label for easy reference.  
- Helps you track and manage multiple DSQs.

**Example**  
- DSQ-01, DSQ-02, DSQ-03, etc.

---

## Slide: Stakeholders
- Identifies the **primary users** or beneficiaries of the DSQ.  
- Use **market segmentation** steps (from *Disciplined Entrepreneurship*) to target your **beachhead** (i.e., the segment most likely to yield maximum value/impact).

**Three Steps to Identify Your Beachhead Stakeholder**  
1. **Brainstorm**: List all potential users (maintenance crews, airlines, suppliers, regulators).  
2. **Narrow Down**: Filter by highest urgency, willingness to adopt, or greatest ROI.  
3. **Primary Research**: Validate with real-world feedback to confirm the most promising stakeholder group (the “beachhead”).

**Example**  
- *Beachhead Stakeholder:* Maintenance supervisors who need real-time engine health analytics.

---

## Slide: Objectives
- States **why** the DSQ is important to the stakeholder.  
- Clarifies the **business or operational goals** behind the question.

**Example**  
- Reduce unscheduled engine maintenance by 30% over the next year.  
- Improve on-time performance of flights.

---

## Slide: Competency
- Outlines the **capabilities** or skills required to address the DSQ effectively.  
- May include data analysis expertise, domain knowledge (e.g., aeronautics, supply chain), or regulatory familiarity.

**Example**  
- Domain knowledge in engine performance metrics.  
- Competency in data integration from multiple sensors.

---

## Slide: Decision
- Pinpoints the **exact choice** that the DSQ will inform.  
- Often a yes/no or selection from multiple options.

**Example**  
- *Decision:* Determine whether to ground specific aircraft for inspection, or continue operation.  
- *Decision:* Identify which engines to prioritize for maintenance budget.

---

## Slide: Decision Support Question (DSQ)
- **The question** that must be answerable via the ontology.  
- Should be **specific**, **measurable**, and **directly relevant** to the decision.

**Example**  
- “Which engines in the fleet have exceeded vibration thresholds in the last 30 days?”

---

## Slide: Potential Classes
- **Ontology entities** you might need to represent in order to answer the DSQ.  
- Classes stem from domain objects, events, or conceptual groupings.

**Example**  
- *Engine*, *Aircraft*, *Fleet*, *Maintenance Event*, *Performance Issue*.

---

## Slide: Potential Data Sources
- **Where to get the data** needed to instantiate the classes and relationships.  
- Data sources must be **accessible**, **reliable**, and **authorized**.

**Example**  
- Flight logs, maintenance records, sensor data, weather databases.  
- OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) component metadata.

---

## Slide: Class Categorization
- High-level grouping of classes (e.g., BFO’s **Continuant** vs. **Occurrent**, or CCO’s classification).  
- Helps with **consistent modeling** and aligning with upper-level ontologies.

**Example**  
- **Engine** (Material Entity, a Continuant).  
- **Flight** (Process, an Occurrent).

---

## Slide: Genus–Species Definition
- **Core principle** in ontology: define a class by its **genus** (broader category) and the **differentia** (distinguishing features).  
- Ensures **logical consistency** and clear placement of each class in the hierarchy.

**Importance**  
1. **Clarity**: Avoids overlapping or ambiguous definitions.  
2. **Consistency**: Aligns each class with a broader ontology (BFO, CCO).  
3. **Extensibility**: Makes it easier to add new subclasses or related concepts later.

**Example**  
- *Jet Engine* = **Engine** (genus) that **produces thrust by expelling hot exhaust gases** (species/differentia).  
- *Engine* is the broader concept; the specific mechanism of thrust (jet propulsion) distinguishes it from other Engine types (like piston engines).

---

## Slide: Object Properties
- **Relationships** between classes (e.g., *isInstalledOn*, *isOperatedBy*, *hasMaintenanceEvent*).  
- Define **how** entities interact or connect, crucial for answering DSQs.

**Example**  
- `JetEngine isInstalledOn Aircraft`.  
- `MaintenanceCrew performs MaintenanceEvent`.  
- `PerformanceEvent hasTimeInterval TimeInterval`.

## Putting It All Together
1. **Identify Stakeholders** using market segmentation to find your beachhead.  
2. **Clarify Objectives & Competencies** for solving their specific problems.  
3. **Define the Decision & DSQ** tightly so the ontology can answer it.  
4. **List Potential Classes & Data Sources** needed to operationalize the DSQ.  
5. **Categorize Classes** under the correct top-level ontologies (BFO, CCO).  
6. Use **Genus–Species Definitions** to ensure rigor and clarity.  
7. Specify **Object Properties** to link classes into a coherent knowledge graph.

This structured approach helps ensure your ontology is **actionable**, **well-scoped**, and aligned with real-world needs, ultimately supporting clear, data-driven decisions.
