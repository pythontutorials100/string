Slide Title: Integrating Diverse Machine Data with Ontologies & Knowledge Graphs
Left Column: Challenges

    Fragmented Data Sources
        Legacy machines with outdated formats
        Proprietary schemas (expensive or inaccessible)
        Limited or missing documentation
    Heterogeneous Outputs
        Different vendors, data structures, and protocols
        Standard vs. non-standard sensor data
    Complexity in Time-Series
        Hard to align timestamps and event sequences without a unified model

Right Column: Ontologies & Knowledge Graphs

    Unified Data Model
        Standardized representation across diverse machines
        Seamlessly integrates legacy, proprietary, and standard data
    Flexible, Scalable Integration
        Knowledge graphs map varied schemas into a coherent structure
        Reduces cost and complexity of data wrangling
    Enhanced Time-Series Analysis
        Temporal insights across all machines in one integrated view
        Consistent metadata for easier analytics and predictions
