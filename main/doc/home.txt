Presentation Development Highlights”

    Conducted Research & Discovery
        Reviewed Model-Based Digital Thread PCC mission and existing RTX digital engineering standards.
        Analyzed relevant industry standards (BFO, CCO, ISO 81346, IOF, OMG, INCOSE) for alignment.

    Structured the Narrative
        Defined a clear flow: PCC mission → Shared Language vision → Industry standards → Ontology value → Stakeholders → Pilots.
        Ensured each slide ties back to the broader objective of seamless data interoperability.

    Created Concise Scripts & Talking Points
        Developed speaker notes that explain key points and maintain audience engagement.
        Balanced technical depth with clarity for diverse stakeholders (engineering, suppliers, leadership).

    Highlighted Practical Examples & Use Cases
        Incorporated tangible examples (e.g., Boeing 787 parts list) to illustrate how a shared ontology addresses real-world complexity.

    Refined Key Messages
        Focused on clear, direct language that emphasizes the immediate value of shared ontologies.
        Showcased benefits such as reduced rework, better decision-making, and simpler supplier collaboration.

    Outlined Next Steps & Collaboration Opportunities
        Suggested pilot projects across Collins, Raytheon, Pratt & Whitney.
        Encouraged broader engagement through workshops, working groups, and industry partnerships.

Update on REO Governance & Presentation

Key Points:

    Preparation of Governance Presentation
        Created a concise slide deck titled “Ontology Governance & Versioning Strategy” to guide the implementation of REO governance.
        Outlined a lightweight governance model, semantic versioning approach, and proposed a monthly meeting cadence.

    Stakeholder Engagement
        Identified essential stakeholders (Executive Sponsors, Ontology Steering Committee, Knowledge Engineers, Domain SMEs) who will be involved in monthly governance calls.
        Established objectives for these meetings, including reviewing proposed ontology changes and ensuring consistent adoption of REO across the organization.

    Workflow & Infrastructure
        Demonstrated how version control (Git) and Ontology Hub (Mobi) can streamline change management and release processes for enterprise ontologies.
        Recommended automated testing (reasoners, SHACL) to ensure ontology quality and consistency.

    Next Steps
        Begin scheduling monthly governance meetings and finalize roles/responsibilities.
        Pilot the governance framework with a small domain ontology to validate the process before organization-wide rollout.

    Value to Organization
        Ensures consistency with BFO/CCO standards while promoting cross-team collaboration.
        Establishes a clear decision-making process and reduces risk of duplication or conflicting definitions.
        Sets the foundation for scalable ontology management across multiple projects and domains.
