1. Strategic Alignment & Value

Feedback:

    Emphasize the importance of tying each connected product to broader business priorities and value.
    Note that ensuring alignment with BU (Business Unit) roadmaps up front can prevent siloed development.

Questions:

    Value Proposition: How do we measure and communicate the value each connected product brings to the BU programs?
    Prioritization: Have we prioritized which connected products get development resources first, based on impact or strategic importance?
    Success Metrics: What KPIs or metrics will define success for each connected product in both the short and long term?

2. Common Tech Stack & Reuse

Feedback:

    Highlight that standardizing architecture, tools, and frameworks early can reduce future maintenance and integration costs.
    Suggest establishing a central architecture governance to ensure reusability across multiple products.

Questions:

    Technical Architecture: Are we defining a reference architecture or set of guidelines to ensure each product is built in a standardized way?
    Reuse Strategy: What reusable components (e.g., libraries, microservices, data models) can be shared across all 10 connected products?
    Infrastructure & DevOps: Have we identified a DevOps or deployment pipeline strategy that fosters continuous integration and reuse across teams?

3. Stakeholder Engagement & Collaboration

Feedback:

    Encouraging a collaborative model with EX/EDX and BU teams will help ensure cross-functional alignment and early buy-in.
    Emphasize that clear roles and responsibilities prevent confusion in large, multi-product initiatives.

Questions:

    Roles and Responsibilities: How are the roles split between EX/EDX, BU teams, and any central program office?
    Communication Cadence: Is there a regular forum or steering committee to keep all stakeholders aligned on roadmap progress and changes?
    Feedback Loop: How do we incorporate feedback and lessons learned from one product into others on an ongoing basis?

4. XETA Requirements & Roadmaps

Feedback:

    Observing that XETA requirements may evolve as technology or market demands shift, building an adaptable roadmap is crucial.
    If XETA ties into compliance or regulatory needs, ensuring alignment with any industry standards from the start saves time and resources.

Questions:

    Scope & Requirements: Are XETA requirements documented at a sufficiently detailed level for each product’s development phase?
    Roadmap Coordination: How do we ensure the XETA roadmap stays synchronized with each BU’s product roadmap, especially if priorities change?
    Risk Management: What is our plan for managing changes in XETA requirements over the lifecycle of these products?

5. Industry Standards (OMG DTC) & Best Practices

Feedback:

    Engaging with industry standards early can position your products to be more interoperable and future-proof.
    Suggest a regular review of new or updated standards to keep the platform current.

Questions:

    Standards Integration: Are we actively mapping our technology decisions to OMG DTC or other IoT/connected-product standards?
    Compliance & Certification: Do we aim for any formal certification with OMG DTC or related bodies?
    Benchmarking: How are we comparing our approach against industry best practices or competitor solutions?

6. Data Strategy & Ontology Hub

Feedback:

    Reinforce that standard data definitions, schemas, and ontologies can drastically simplify analytics and cross-product integration.
    Data governance policies should be established early to ensure quality, security, and compliance.

Questions:

    Ontology Development: Who is defining the ontologies in the Ontology Hub, and how do we ensure they meet both short-term needs (e.g., minimal viable set of definitions) and future scalability?
    Data Governance: What policies or governance frameworks are in place to ensure data consistency, security, and integrity across connected products?
    Integration & Interoperability: How easily can data from these connected products be integrated with each other or with third-party systems?

7. Long-Term Sustainability & Evolution

Feedback:

    Highlight that connected products have lifecycle requirements (firmware updates, security patches, expansions). Building a model for ongoing maintenance is crucial.
    Market and technology shifts require agility; planning for future expansions or pivot opportunities is key.

Questions:

    Lifecycle Management: Do we have an established process for software updates, security patches, and new feature rollouts across all connected products?
    Scalability: Does our architecture and resource planning account for scaling the user base or additional features?
    Future Technologies: How will we incorporate new technologies (e.g., AI/ML, edge computing, advanced sensors) into the existing stack without major rework?

8. Program Management & Execution

Feedback:

    Strong cross-team program management ensures that each product’s timeline, budget, and scope remain on track.
    Using phased milestones can keep stakeholders informed and reduce risk.

Questions:

    Phase Gates & Milestones: Are there defined checkpoints where we evaluate progress or pivot strategy if needed?
    Resource Allocation: How is the team ensuring we have the right level of resources (technical, financial, personnel) to deliver on schedule?
    Risk Mitigation: What are the major risks (technical, market, organizational) we’ve identified, and how are we mitigating them?
