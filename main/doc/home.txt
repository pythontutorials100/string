Subject: Guest Lecture on Dependency Structure Matrix â€“ Feb 24, 4 PM PT

Hi [Manager's Name],

I wanted to inform you that I will be delivering a guest lecture on Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) for the Astronautical Engineering MS students at USC on Feb 24 at 4 PM PT. This is a lecture I have been delivering for the past 4-5 years during my time as a Teaching Assistant at USC.

Prof. [Professor's Name] requested me to deliver this lecture as a favor, and this is not a paid engagement. The content is publicly available, and here is the presentation I will be using: https://www.shatad.com/matrix-methods.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Shatad
