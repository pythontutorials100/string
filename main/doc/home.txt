1. Governance Overview
1.1 Governance Structure

    Steering Committee / Working Group
        A small cross-functional team (with representation from each domain-ontology group and your central enterprise ontology team) that meets regularly.
        Responsible for reviewing proposed changes, enforcing standards, and approving new ontology releases.
        The committee can meet monthly or quarterly, depending on the rate of ontology evolution.

    Ontology Librarian / Curator
        One or two individuals with the responsibility to oversee day-to-day ontology management, coordinate changes, and monitor version control.
        They act as the single point of contact for questions about naming, versioning, release schedules, etc.

    Change Request Process
        Require teams to submit changes (via a “ticket” system, a Git pull request, or your internal workflow tool) to the working group for review.
        Changes should include rationale, impact assessment, and proposed version increments.

1.2 Governance Principles

    Transparency: All ontology changes are documented, tracked, and visible.
    Backward Compatibility: Avoid breaking changes unless absolutely necessary. If you must break backward compatibility, increment the major version.
    Single Source of Truth: The Ontology Hub (Mobi or any other central repository you designate) stores all “official” versions with their metadata.
    Regular Cadence: Set a predictable release cycle so that end-users (downstream applications, data pipelines) can plan updates and testing.

2. Versioning Strategy

A consistent versioning scheme allows anyone to see how mature an ontology is and whether updates break compatibility. A common, easy-to-implement approach for RDF/OWL ontologies is to leverage Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

    MAJOR: Large, possibly backward-incompatible changes (e.g., major class refactoring, radical changes in the hierarchy, or dropping key elements).
    MINOR: Backward-compatible changes that add or extend concepts (e.g., new classes, properties, individuals).
    PATCH: Bug fixes or minor clarifications with no impact on existing data (e.g., fixing typos in labels, adding synonyms).

2.1 Version IRI vs. Base IRI

OWL best practices encourage the use of two IRIs:

    Base (Persistent) IRI – e.g., http://example.com/ontologies/REO#
    Versioned IRI – e.g., http://example.com/ontologies/REO/1.1.0#

The Base IRI remains constant, while the Versioned IRI changes with every release. Inside the ontology file, you’d typically set:

<http://example.com/ontologies/REO/1.1.0>
    rdf:type owl:Ontology ;
    owl:versionIRI <http://example.com/ontologies/REO/1.1.0> ;
    owl:versionInfo "1.1.0" ;
    ...
.

When users or tools load the “latest” version from your Ontology Hub Mobi, they can link to the base IRI or a specific version IRI, depending on their preference.
2.2 Release Cadence

    Enterprise-Level Ontology (REO):
        Recommend major releases annually or bi-annually (to ensure stability).
        Minor releases can happen quarterly if new classes/properties need to be added.
        Patch releases can happen anytime a small fix is needed.
    Domain-Level Ontologies (MRO, DPHM, etc.):
        These often change more frequently due to project-specific needs.
        A monthly or quarterly minor release cycle is often sufficient.
        Whenever a domain ontology depends on (or extends) REO, ensure the domain version references the correct REO version.

2.3 Namespaces & Naming Conventions

    Keep the base namespace short and descriptive.
    Each domain ontology has its own base IRI, e.g.:
        http://example.com/ontologies/MRO#
        http://example.com/ontologies/DPHM#
    For the ontology files themselves, name them in a way that reflects the version, e.g.:
        reo-1.1.0.ttl
        mro-2.0.3.ttl
    Within each ontology, ensure standard labeling of classes and properties with consistent naming style (e.g., CamelCase for classes, lowerCamelCase for properties) if that is your standard.

3. Tooling & Infrastructure
3.1 Ontology Hub Mobi

Since you already have an Ontology Hub Mobi tool deployed, use it as the central registry of truth. Key points:

    Automated Uploads/Updates:
        Whenever a new version is approved, the curator uploads it (or triggers an automated pipeline to do so) along with associated metadata: version number, release date, change log, etc.
    Browse and Discovery:
        Ensure that external teams can easily discover the latest “stable” or recommended version vs. older versions.
        Provide a pinned “Latest Release” link or an RDF fetch endpoint that always points to the current stable release.
    Dependency Tracking:
        If domain ontology MRO depends on REO version 1.1.0, record that relationship in the Hub so it’s clear which versions are linked.

3.2 Version Control System (e.g., Git)

Even though your ontologies are in Turtle or RDF, consider storing them in a Git repository:

    Branching Model
        Main/Trunk: Stable release line (only bug fixes land here).
        Develop: Ongoing development or next minor/major release.
        Feature Branches: Each new ontology feature or fix is developed in its own branch, merged into develop after review, and eventually released.
    Pull Request / Merge Request Reviews
        Changes to classes, properties, labels, etc. can be reviewed by the domain experts and the governance group before merging.
        The committee or curator approves merges, ensuring quality control.
    Automated Tests
        Use an OWL reasoner check or shape constraints (SHACL) to ensure changes do not introduce logical inconsistencies.

3.3 Release Automation

A lightweight continuous integration (CI) pipeline can:

    Validate ontologies (reasoning, SHACL checks).
    Increment the version number upon approval.
    Generate updated documentation (e.g., HTML or PDF class lists) from the RDF.
    Deploy the new version to Ontology Hub Mobi with the correct version metadata.

4. Distribution and Usage
4.1 Downloading the Correct Ontology

    “Stable” Tag or Alias: Provide a URL or an alias (like latest) that always points to the newest stable version.
    Versioned URL: For teams that require a specific version, make older versions accessible under their explicit IRIs or file names.
    Change Logs: Publish a short summary of changes in each new release (major/minor/patch) so teams understand how their usage might be affected.

4.2 Communication & Training

    Provide short training sessions (or internal wiki pages) to help users understand:
        How to interpret version numbers (semantic versioning basics).
        How to reference the correct ontology version in their projects.
        Best practices for submitting new concepts or requesting changes.

5. Specific Recommendations for Long-Term, Easy Implementation

    Keep Semantic Versioning Simple:
        Do not overcomplicate with too many intermediate versions. Generally, changes will fit easily into the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH approach.

    Stable Release Cycles:
        Enterprise Ontology (REO) – stable annual release (e.g., 1.0.0, 2.0.0, …) plus minor increments as needed.
        Domain Ontologies – monthly or quarterly if they evolve faster.

    Encourage “Latest” Usage for Most Teams:
        Many teams will just want the “most correct” version. Offer a “latest stable” alias.
        Projects with strict validation or certification may pin themselves to a specific version if required.

    Lightweight Governance:
        A monthly or bi-monthly working group meeting is enough for most large enterprises.
        Maintain an internal knowledge base where every approved update is documented.

    Automate Where Possible:
        If your existing environment supports it, build a pipeline that takes “approved changes” from Git → does reasoner checks → updates version number → publishes the new .ttl or .rdf to Ontology Hub Mobi.

    Document “When to Bump the Version”:
        e.g., “If I’m just fixing a spelling mistake, that’s a PATCH. If I’m adding a new class or property, that’s a MINOR. If I’m restructuring the top-level class hierarchy, that’s a MAJOR.”

6. Example Scenario

    User Submits a Change
        The MRO team wants to add five new classes related to advanced maintenance workflows. They open a ticket/PR, referencing the current MRO ontology version (2.0.0).

    Review and Approve
        The domain experts ensure no conflicts, the changes pass a reasoner check, and the governance group approves it.

    Version Update
        Since this is adding classes (backward-compatible), the new version becomes 2.1.0 (MINOR update).

    Release
        The pipeline updates the versioned IRI, finalizes the Turtle file as mro-2.1.0.ttl, and publishes it to the Ontology Hub with metadata:
            versionInfo = “2.1.0”
            date = “2025-01-30”
            changeLog = “Added classes for advanced workflow..”

    Consumption
        Other teams pulling the MRO ontology from “latest stable MRO” now get 2.1.0. Teams that pinned to 2.0.0 remain on that version until they decide to upgrade.

5. Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
5.1 What is Semantic Versioning?

    MAJOR: Backward-incompatible changes (e.g., restructuring core classes).
    MINOR: Backward-compatible additions (e.g., adding new classes, properties).
    PATCH: Small fixes (e.g., typos, minor label edits) with no functional impact.

5.2 Why Semantic Versioning?

    Familiarity: Developers and technical teams often expect it.
    Clarity: Quickly communicates the significance of an update.
    Easy Management: Straightforward to automate in CI/CD pipelines.

5.3 Examples

    REO 1.2.0 → REO 1.3.0: Adding new classes or properties.
    REO 1.3.0 → REO 2.0.0: Major structural change that may break existing references.

6. Tooling & Infrastructure
6.1 Ontology Hub Mobi

    Central Repository: Official source of truth for all validated ontology versions.
    Metadata & Release Notes: Each version entry includes a change log, release date, and semantic version (e.g., REO 1.2.0).
    Browse & Discovery: Users can find current stable versions or older versions if needed.

6.2 Version Control (Git or Similar)

    Branching Model:
        Main: Holds stable releases.
        Develop: Next release under development.
        Feature Branches: Where new changes are implemented before merging.
    Pull Requests:
        Proposed changes are reviewed and merged only after approval.
    Automated Validation:
        OWL reasoning checks, SHACL validations to prevent logical inconsistencies.

6.3 Release Automation (Optional)

    CI/CD Pipelines:
        Validate ontologies with reasoning/SHACL checks.
        Automatically bump version numbers upon merge.
        Publish updated RDF/Turtle files to Ontology Hub Mobi.

7. Workflow & Release Cadence
7.1 High-Level Workflow

    Propose Change: A domain team (e.g., MRO) needs to add classes → Submits PR.
    Review & Approval: Steering Committee + Curator reviews for consistency with REO, domain logic, and naming conventions.
    Merge & Version Bump:
        If backward-compatible, increment MINOR.
        If it’s just a small fix, increment PATCH.
        If it’s disruptive, increment MAJOR.
    Publish: Update Ontology Hub Mobi with the new version. Record change log.

7.2 Frequency & Scheduling

    Enterprise Ontology (REO):
        Major releases: ~1x/year (if needed for big structural changes).
        Minor releases: As needed (e.g., quarterly) for new classes/relations.
        Patch releases: Whenever small fixes occur.
    Domain Ontologies (MRO, DPHM, etc.):
        Typically evolve more quickly, so expect more frequent minor/patch increments.
        Must align with the current stable version of REO unless there's a planned major update.

8. Naming Conventions & Dependencies
8.1 Namespaces & Filenames

    Namespaces: Keep them concise and consistent.
        Example: <http://example.com/ontologies/REO/1.2.0> for version 1.2.0.
    File Names: reo-1.2.0.ttl, mro-1.0.3.ttl, etc.

8.2 Tracking Dependencies

    Domain Ontologies: Indicate which version of REO they extend.
        e.g., MRO 1.1.0 extends REO 1.2.0.
    Backward Compatibility: Avoid frequent major releases in REO to minimize disruption to domain ontologies.
