Slide: Objectives

    States why the DSQ is important to the stakeholder.
    Clarifies the business or operational goals behind the question.

Example

    Reduce unscheduled engine maintenance by 30% over the next year.
    Improve on-time performance of flights.

Slide: Competency

    Outlines the capabilities or skills required to address the DSQ effectively.
    May include data analysis expertise, domain knowledge (e.g., aeronautics, supply chain), or regulatory familiarity.

Example

    Domain knowledge in engine performance metrics.
    Competency in data integration from multiple sensors.

Slide: Decision

    Pinpoints the exact choice that the DSQ will inform.
    Often a yes/no or selection from multiple options.

Example

    Decision: Determine whether to ground specific aircraft for inspection, or continue operation.
    Decision: Identify which engines to prioritize for maintenance budget.

Slide: Decision Support Question (DSQ)

    The question that must be answerable via the ontology.
    Should be specific, measurable, and directly relevant to the decision.

Example

    “Which engines in the fleet have exceeded vibration thresholds in the last 30 days?”

Slide: Potential Classes

    Ontology entities you might need to represent in order to answer the DSQ.
    Classes stem from domain objects, events, or conceptual groupings.

Example

    Engine, Aircraft, Fleet, Maintenance Event, Performance Issue.

Slide: Potential Data Sources

    Where to get the data needed to instantiate the classes and relationships.
    Data sources must be accessible, reliable, and authorized.

Example

    Flight logs, maintenance records, sensor data, weather databases.
    OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) component metadata.

Slide: Class Categorization

    High-level grouping of classes (e.g., BFO’s Continuant vs. Occurrent, or CCO’s classification).
    Helps with consistent modeling and aligning with upper-level ontologies.

Example

    Engine (Material Entity, a Continuant).
    Flight (Process, an Occurrent).

Slide: Genus–Species Definition

    Core principle in ontology: define a class by its genus (broader category) and the differentia (distinguishing features).
    Ensures logical consistency and clear placement of each class in the hierarchy.

Importance

    Clarity: Avoids overlapping or ambiguous definitions.
    Consistency: Aligns each class with a broader ontology (BFO, CCO).
    Extensibility: Makes it easier to add new subclasses or related concepts later.

Example

    Jet Engine = Engine (genus) that produces thrust by expelling hot exhaust gases (species/differentia).
    Engine is the broader concept; the specific mechanism of thrust (jet propulsion) distinguishes it from other Engine types (like piston engines).

Slide: Object Properties

    Relationships between classes (e.g., isInstalledOn, isOperatedBy, hasMaintenanceEvent).
    Define how entities interact or connect, crucial for answering DSQs.

Example

    JetEngine isInstalledOn Aircraft.
    MaintenanceCrew performs MaintenanceEvent.
    PerformanceEvent hasTimeInterval TimeInterval.

Putting It All Together

    Identify Stakeholders using market segmentation to find your beachhead.
    Clarify Objectives & Competencies for solving their specific problems.
    Define the Decision & DSQ tightly so the ontology can answer it.
    List Potential Classes & Data Sources needed to operationalize the DSQ.
    Categorize Classes under the correct top-level ontologies (BFO, CCO).
    Use Genus–Species Definitions to ensure rigor and clarity.
    Specify Object Properties to link classes into a coherent knowledge graph.

This structured approach helps ensure your ontology is actionable, well-scoped, and aligned with real-world needs, ultimately supporting clear, data-driven decisions.
