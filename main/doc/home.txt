Thanks for the update — this is a great opportunity to align efforts and share value across teams.

Hello Luis, 

We’ve developed and curated a core enterprise ontology called REO (RTX Enterprise Ontology), grounded in formal logic using OWL. REO is based on the ISO-standard foundational ontology BFO (Basic Formal Ontology).

REO includes reusable modeling patterns for:

Information modeling

Quality modeling

Temporal modeling

Financial value modeling

Material traceability modeling

And more. 

Portion of these could be reused. REO is formal logic-based and support rich reasoning and inferencing capabilities.

I'd be also be very interested in understanding your approach to extracting OWL ontologies from Cameo models, and how that work can be shared and integrated into O-hub. 

Here is a link to O-hub: 

I’ll share a short presentation ahead of the meeting to provide some background.

I've sent a meeting invite for Monday at 3 PM ET.


==============

Purpose:
Informational and alignment session on ontology assets and integration opportunities.

Agenda:

    Overview of REO and standards base (BFO, CCO)

    Review of your Cameo-to-OWL approach and use case

    O-hub access and governance overview

    Identify fit and next steps


Agenda:

    REO overview and standards base (BFO, CCO)

    Walkthrough of your Cameo-to-OWL work and use case

    O-hub sharing and governance

    Identify fit, opportunities, and next steps



Introduce REO and our existing ontology assets; understand how the Air Force modeling effort can align and contribute to O-hub.
