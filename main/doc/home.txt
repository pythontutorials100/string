Model-Based Digital Thread PCC
Mission

Accelerate digital engineering adoption across RTX by coordinating strategy, roadmaps, and best practices.
Core Responsibilities

    Roadmap & Adoption: Define and guide DE priorities company-wide
    Standards Alignment: Coordinate internal standards; contribute to industry-wide initiatives
    Capability Maturation: Evolve DE competencies for Collins, Raytheon, Pratt & Whitney, and others
    Technology Engagement: Identify and integrate key tools and vendors

Top Priorities

    Integrated Digital Collaboration
    DE Standardization
    Connected Product Data

Outcome: Faster innovation, reduced duplication, and a unified digital thread that benefits all teams, customers, and suppliers.


Our mission is simple: we accelerate digital engineering adoption across RTX by coordinating strategy, roadmaps, and best practices. We do this so every team—from Collins to Raytheon to Pratt & Whitney—can operate more efficiently and consistently.

We focus on four core responsibilities:

    Roadmap & Adoption: We outline and guide the top digital engineering priorities, ensuring everyone’s moving in the same direction.
    Standards Alignment: We align internal standards and also engage with industry-wide efforts, so we stay ahead of emerging best practices.
    Capability Maturation: We help each business unit refine and grow their digital engineering skill sets, leveraging shared knowledge and lessons learned.
    Technology Engagement: We identify and integrate the right tools and vendor partnerships to streamline our digital transformation.

Currently, we have three top priorities:

    Integrated Digital Collaboration – so teams can work seamlessly across geographies and functions.
    Digital Engineering Standardization – to ensure a common language and consistent processes.
    Connected Product Data – tying information together across the entire product lifecycle.

The outcome we’re driving toward is faster innovation, reduced duplication, and a unified digital thread that benefits all of our teams, customers, and suppliers. In short, the PCC is about getting everyone on the same page to deliver better results, faster.
