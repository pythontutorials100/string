Below is a concise slide‐by‐slide outline you can use to prepare a direct, clear, and tightly‐focused kick‐off presentation. Each slide has key bullet points. You can adapt the wording and visual style as needed, but this structure should keep the message on point.

Slide 1: Title & Introduction
Title:
Airfoil Distress & EagleBlend Ontology Kick‐Off
Subtitle:
Enabling Computable Business Rules for Turbine Blade Repair and Sustainment
Key Points:
•	Welcome and introduction
•	High‐level project goal: “Create ontologies & knowledge graphs to describe and query airfoil distress, supporting enterprise repair processes.”
•	Date / Presenter / Stakeholders
________________________________________
Slide 2: Statement of Work (SoW) & Objectives
What We’re Building
•	Ontologies that describe: 
1.	Airfoil Distress (PPI Standard Indication Report)
2.	EagleBlend Results for Repair Disposition
•	Integration with Enterprise Ontology to make business rules computable.
Why It Matters
•	Addresses all aftermarket programs (not just a one‐off).
•	Supports turbine blade PPI work at the Repair Center.
•	Aligns with best practices in data management & governance.
•	Ontologies are vital for data interoperability and digital thread continuity.
________________________________________
Slide 3: High‐Level Approach
1.	Data Modeling
o	Review PPI standard indication reports & EagleBlend data structures.
o	Incorporate business rules for airfoil repair dispositions.
2.	Ontology Development
o	Define classes, properties, relationships, and constraints.
o	Align with an Enterprise Ontology foundation (to ensure consistent usage across programs).
3.	Reasoning & Queries
o	Formalize rules so they can be used for automated inferences (e.g., “Which defects exceed a repair threshold?”).
o	Develop SPARQL or reasoning queries to answer Decision Support Questions.
4.	Implementation & Loading
o	Load the data into a Knowledge Graph (e.g., Stardog).
o	Test queries with real or sample data to ensure correctness.
5.	Training & Workshops
o	Teach stakeholders how to use the ontology and query the KG.
o	Gather feedback for improvements.

Slide 4: Deliverables & Timeline
Key Deliverables:
1.	Ontology & Supporting Documentation
2.	Reasoning & Query Templates
3.	Knowledge Graph (KG) Implementation
4.	Workshops & Training
5.	Decision Support Dashboards (optional/if applicable)
Proposed Timeline (Illustrative):
•	Weeks 1–2: Requirements gathering, data review, initial ontology draft
•	Weeks 3–4: Ontology refinement, preliminary reasoning & queries, first KG load
•	Weeks 5–6: Testing & validation, iteration with domain experts
•	Weeks 7–8: Training sessions, final acceptance, documentation
(Adjust based on actual scope and availability.)
________________________________________
Slide 5: Decision Support Questions (Examples)
1.	Defect Sizing & Thresholds 
o	“Which blades exhibit a leading‐edge defect deeper than X mm?”
2.	Repair Feasibility 
o	“Which indications are beyond repair limits and require replacement?”
3.	Part Tracking & History 
o	“Which part IDs have repeated leading‐edge damages over multiple maintenance intervals?”
4.	Cost Analysis 
o	“How many blades have an expected repair cost that exceeds a certain threshold?”
Goal: Show how the ontology and KG can answer these queries automatically.
________________________________________
Slide 6: Next Steps & Action Items
1.	Data Availability
o	Confirm all relevant PPI reports / EagleBlend data sets.
o	Identify any missing data elements.
2.	Validation Sessions
o	Schedule workshops to confirm domain rules with SMEs.
3.	Integration Points
o	Decide how the KG will interface with existing VAULTIS or other systems.
o	Outline any potential CAD or other tool integrations.
4.	Meeting Cadence & Check‐Ins
o	Bi‐weekly progress calls, monthly review?
o	Final acceptance sign‐off criteria.
Q&A
•	Invite input or final questions from stakeholders.

Presentation Tips
1.	Keep It Visual: Include simple, high‐level diagrams (e.g., a box labeled “Ontology” feeding into a box labeled “Knowledge Graph,” which then supports “Repair Decision.”)
2.	Stay Aligned to the SoW: Tie each slide back to the statement of work and the business value.
3.	Be Concise: The outline above is meant to keep your deck short—6 slides max.
With this presentation structure, you’ll give the customer a clear, direct, and cohesive view of the project’s scope, timeline, and expected outcomes, setting you up for a smooth and well‐aligned kick‐off.


Below is an expanded project plan slide (or section of your presentation) that emphasizes clear timelines and milestones. Feel free to tailor the exact durations to your specific team capacity and the customer’s urgency.
