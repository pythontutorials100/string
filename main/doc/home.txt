Ontology: High-Level Benefits
1. Unified Structure for Complex Data

    We blend data from multiple formats (CSV, JSON) into a single knowledge graph.

    The ontology standardizes how we name and relate concepts (defects, blends, measurements).

2. Better Insights & Analytics

    Consistent modeling enables richer queries: e.g. find all airfoil defects deeper than X inches on the leading edge.

    Measurement entities (ICE/MICE) and domain-specific classes let us slice data by dimension, location, etc.

3. Greater Interoperability

    Built on BFO & CCO: recognized frameworks that support cross-domain integration.

    Aligns with best practices, making it easier to extend or link to other ontologies or enterprise systems.

4. Reduced Data Silos

    Instead of separate CSV/JSON spreadsheets, data becomes centrally accessible in a knowledge graph.

    Automated scripts populate the graph, ensuring data is kept up-to-date and consistent across teams.

5. Scalability & Maintenance

    Ontology-driven approach allows easier updates: new defect types or blend parameters can be added without breaking existing data.

    Clear definitions and relationships make the system maintainable over time.

Enables Cross-Source Integration:
“By using a common, semantically rich structure, this ontology unifies data across different sources—allowing us to discover new insights and perform advanced analytics that weren’t possible when the data existed in separate silos.”
