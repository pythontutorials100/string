Agent Ontology: Modeling People, Organizations, and Their Roles
Key Concepts

    Agent: Top-level class representing both
        Individual Agents (e.g., Person)
        Organizational Agents (e.g., Organization)
    Qualities: Attributes of agents (e.g., HEIGHT, WEIGHT, EYE COLOR)
    Roles: Context-specific functions an agent performs (e.g., CITIZEN ROLE, OCCUPATION ROLE, ALLY ROLE)

Why It Matters

    Enables precise modeling of who does what and in which organizational context
    Supports realistic complexity: people can hold multiple roles, organizations can be designated by names, etc.
    Facilitates linking persons and organizations to events (e.g., a graduation or professional activity)

Example 1 (Figure 5)

    Person 1 (John Doe) has an Occupation Role (Doctor Role)
    Role is contextualized by an Organization (United Health Systems)
    Each name (for the person or organization) is a Designative Information Content Entity linking to the text value

Key Relationships

person 1 - has role -> doctor role 1
doctor role 1 - has organizational context -> healthcare organization 1

Example 2 (Figure 6)

    Person 1 (John Doe) and an Educational Organization (University of Rochester)
    Both participate in an Act of Educational Training Acquisition over a multi-year interval
    Graduation Event is a part of that educational process

Key Relationships

person 1 - agent in -> act of educational training acquisition 1
educational organization 1 - participates in -> act of educational training acquisition 1
act of educational training acquisition 1 - has process part -> graduation event 1

    Tip: Emphasize how the Agent Ontology integrates seamlessly with Time Ontology and Event Ontology to capture the who, when, and where of real-world processes.
