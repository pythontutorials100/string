Motivating Scenarios: Begin with real-world story problems or use cases that highlight why the ontology is needed. This helps clarify gaps in existing models and provide rationale for new terms and relations.
Informal Competency Questions: Extract from each scenario a set of “informal” questions that the ontology must be able to answer—these become your high-level requirements.
Terminology (in FOL): Formally define the objects, attributes, and relations that will address those competency questions. This ensures that any query or inference you want to make can be precisely stated in your ontology’s language.
Formal Competency Questions: Express each competency question as a logical entailment or consistency problem in first-order logic.
Axioms: Capture all definitions and constraints on the terms in the ontology. These axioms give meaning to the terminology—without them, the ontology is incomplete.
Completeness Theorems: Finally, evaluate whether the ontology can indeed answer the competency questions. Proving completeness theorems (or at least systematically testing the ontology with examples) ensures the ontology’s adequacy.
