Agent Ontology: Modeling People, Organizations, and Their Roles in Jet Engine Manufacturing
Key Concepts

    Agent: Top-level class representing:
        Individual Agents (e.g., Person)
        Organizational Agents (e.g., Manufacturer, Supplier, Subsidiary)
    Qualities: Attributes of agents (e.g., HEIGHT, WEIGHT, SECURITY CLEARANCE)
    Roles: Context-specific functions or duties (e.g., ENGINE TECHNICIAN ROLE, SUPERVISOR ROLE, QUALITY INSPECTOR ROLE)

Why It Matters (in Aerospace Manufacturing)

    Capture who performs which tasks on the production line (technicians, inspectors, managers).
    Link employees’ roles and certifications to the organization (e.g., a specific jet-engine manufacturer).
    Enable consistent representation of people and teams, ensuring clarity in big projects (e.g., new jet-engine design rollout).

Example 1: Agents in Organizational Context

Imagine a Production Technician working at Jet Engines Inc. to assemble a new X-2000 turbofan engine.

    Person 1 (e.g., “Jane Smith”)
        Has an Occupation Role = Production Technician Role
    Jet Engines Inc. (an Organization)
        Linked to the technician’s role via has organizational context

Key CCO Concepts & Relations

person 1  --has role--> production technician role 1
production technician role 1  --has organizational context--> jet engines inc.

Name Representation

    person name 1 (a Designative Information Content Entity) -> “Jane Smith”
    organization name 1 -> “Jet Engines Inc.”

Visual: (Slide diagram)

    Show a Person box, linked by “has role” arrow to Production Technician Role, which in turn links by “has organizational context” arrow to Jet Engines Inc..
    Each name uses “Designative Information Content Entity” and an “Information Bearing Entity” holding the text value (e.g., “Jane Smith”).

Example 2: Agents in a Test Event

Now consider Engine Acceptance Testing, where technicians and the quality department participate in a multi-day process:

    Person 1 = “Jane Smith”
        agent in → Engine Acceptance Test Event
        She holds the Quality Inspector Role (at some points) or remains a Production Technician (multiple roles over time).

    Manufacturer Organization = “Jet Engines Inc.”
        Also participates in the test event (as the responsible entity).

    Engine Acceptance Test Event
        Occurs over a multi-day temporal interval
        Has sub-processes (e.g., “Day 1: Visual Inspection”, “Day 2: Performance Bench Test”)

Key Relations

person 1  --agent in--> engine acceptance test event 1
engine acceptance test event 1  --occurs on--> multi-day temporal interval 1

Name Representation

    The day or date (e.g., “2025-06-12”) can be stored as a literal value within a Designative Information Content Entity (for the temporal interval).

Takeaways

    Clear Separation of Entities: A Person is distinct from her Role and from the Organization.
    Reusable: The same pattern can capture technicians, inspectors, managers, etc., each with different roles.
    Extensible: Tie into other CCO modules (Time Ontology, Event Ontology) to represent when a role is active and which events the agent participates in.

    Key Benefit: By leveraging CCO’s Agent Ontology patterns, jet-engine manufacturers avoid reinventing the wheel for modeling workforce structure, roles, and organizational contexts—leading to more consistent, interoperable data across production, inspection, and testing activities.
