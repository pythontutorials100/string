Motivating Scenarios: Begin with real-world story problems or use cases that highlight why the ontology is needed. This helps clarify gaps in existing models and provide rationale for new terms and relations.
Informal Competency Questions: Extract from each scenario a set of “informal” questions that the ontology must be able to answer—these become your high-level requirements.
Terminology (in FOL): Formally define the objects, attributes, and relations that will address those competency questions. This ensures that any query or inference you want to make can be precisely stated in your ontology’s language.
Formal Competency Questions: Express each competency question as a logical entailment or consistency problem in first-order logic.
Axioms: Capture all definitions and constraints on the terms in the ontology. These axioms give meaning to the terminology—without them, the ontology is incomplete.
Completeness Theorems: Finally, evaluate whether the ontology can indeed answer the competency questions. Proving completeness theorems (or at least systematically testing the ontology with examples) ensures the ontology’s adequacy.


1. Big-Picture Methodology

The core framework is built around four interlinked steps:

    Motivating Scenario
        Present a real-world scenario or story problem that current ontologies struggle to address.
        This scenario sets the stage for why new or extended ontologies are needed.

    Competency Questions
        Derive a set of questions (the “competency questions”) that the ontology must be able to answer if it is to solve the problem identified in the motivating scenario.
        Two levels:
            Informal Competency Questions: High-level, human-readable questions (e.g., “What activities must a particular agent perform?”).
            Formal Competency Questions: These same questions expressed rigorously in a logical language (first-order logic, for example), so that they can be tested against the ontology’s axioms.

    Specification in First-Order Logic
        Terminology: Define the objects (classes, instances), attributes (unary predicates), and relations (n-ary predicates) that you need to answer the competency questions.
        Axioms: State the constraints, rules, and definitions that give this terminology its meaning. This is the actual logical theory.

    Completeness Theorems / Ontology Evaluation
        Prove (or at least demonstrate) that the axioms are both necessary and sufficient to answer the competency questions.
        If the ontology cannot fully answer them, it must be extended until it can.
