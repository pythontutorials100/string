(Slide 1: What is R2RML?)

"Alright everyone, let's dive into R2RML.

First off, what does it stand for? R2RML means RDB to RDF Mapping Language.

At its core, R2RML is a W3C Standard – that means it's a formal, recognized recommendation for defining mappings between relational data and RDF. You can find the official specification on the W3C website if you want the full technical details.

So, what's its Purpose? R2RML provides a declarative language – essentially, a way to describe the rules – for transforming data that lives in your traditional relational databases (think tables, SQL views, or even specific SQL query results) into the RDF triple format.

Think of it like a set of instructions. It tells a system exactly how to take each row, or specific parts of a row, from your database and convert it into linked RDF statements – those Subject-Predicate-Object triples we know from the graph world.

And importantly, these mapping rules themselves are written in Turtle syntax (the .ttl files). This is neat because it means the mapping definitions are themselves valid RDF data, making them readable and potentially processable as linked data."

"Okay, so we know what it is... but Why Use R2RML? What are the key benefits?

(Slide 2: Why Use R2RML? Key Benefits)

"This is where it gets really interesting. One of the primary advantages is that R2RML allows you to query your existing relational data directly using SPARQL, without physically moving or duplicating that data into a separate graph database. Remember how we interacted with SQLite using SPARQL? R2RML is often the standard behind how that kind of virtual access works. The system uses the R2RML rules to translate your SPARQL queries into SQL queries on-the-fly, fetches the results from the relational database, and then presents them back to you as if they were RDF all along.

Beyond that powerful capability, using R2RML brings other significant benefits:

    Standardization: It provides a common, vendor-neutral language. If you define your mappings using R2RML, different tools and platforms that support the standard should be able to understand and use them. This avoids vendor lock-in for your mapping logic.

    Reusability: Because it's a standard, these mapping files can be shared, understood, and potentially reused across different projects or even different organizations using compatible tools.

    Separation of Concerns: R2RML helps keep your mapping logic distinct from your application code and separate from the underlying databases. This makes your overall architecture cleaner and easier to maintain. The mapping definition lives in its own file.

    ETL Use Case: While the virtual querying is a major draw, R2RML isn't limited to that. You can also use these same mapping definitions in traditional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes if you do want to physically convert your relational data into RDF triples and load it into a native RDF store."

"So, it sounds useful, but How Does it Actually Work at a conceptual level? Let's look at the core building blocks.

(Slide 3: How Does it Work? Core Concepts)

"The fundamental Goal of an R2RML mapping file is always the same: Specify rules to generate RDF Triples – those Subject - Predicate - Object structures – based on the data found in your relational table rows.

To achieve this, R2RML defines specific vocabulary, essentially key building blocks within the mapping file:

    The main container is the rr:TriplesMap. Think of a TriplesMap as defining the mapping rules for one logical source of data – typically this corresponds to one specific database table, view, or the result of a particular SQL query.

    Inside a TriplesMap, you first define where the data comes from using rr:logicalTable. This can be as simple as specifying a table name, like rr:tableName "Persons", or it could be a custom SQL query using rr:sqlQuery "SELECT id, name, city FROM Employees WHERE active=1", for example.

    Next, you need to define how the Subject of the triples will be created for each row. That's done using the rr:subjectMap. Very often, this involves creating a URI using a template pattern that includes values from the row, typically the primary key. For instance, you might define a template like http://example.com/person/{id} where {id} gets replaced by the value from the 'id' column for each row, ensuring a unique URI for each person.

    Finally, you define the Predicate and Object pairs using one or more rr:predicateObjectMap sections within the TriplesMap.

        For each predicateObjectMap, you specify the Predicate, which is simply the URI for the property you want to assert (like foaf:name for a person's name).

        And you specify how to get the Object. This could be a literal value taken directly from a database column (like pulling the string "Alice" from the 'name' column), or it could be another URI, perhaps linking this subject to another resource defined in a different TriplesMap (like linking a person to their company)."
