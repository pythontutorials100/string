1. Objectives

    Definition: High-level business or operational goals that the question aims to fulfill or contribute to.
    Why Keep It?
        Helps clarify why the DSQ matters (i.e., the “bigger picture” outcome).
        Ensures alignment with strategic or project goals.
    Potential Overlap?
        Sometimes Objectives are merged into a “Goal” field or are implicit in the DSQ itself.
        If you have a strong top-level “goal” statement for the entire ontology, you might not need a separate Objectives column per DSQ.

Example

    Objective: “Reduce unscheduled engine maintenance incidents by 30% within a year.”

2. Competency

    Definition: The capabilities (knowledge or skills) required to address the DSQ. In traditional ontology methodologies, “Competency Questions” are questions the ontology must be competent to answer.
    Why Keep It?
        Forces you to specify domain expertise or data-analysis skills needed to interpret data (e.g., engine thermodynamics, flight data analytics).
        Clarifies any specialized or regulatory knowledge that must be present in the organization or ontology.
    Potential Overlap?
        DSQs are sometimes directly called “Competency Questions,” leading some teams to see this column as redundant.
        If your template’s DSQ column already covers what the ontology must do, you might choose to fold Competency into Objectives or skip it altogether.

Example

    Competency: “Familiarity with engine health monitoring systems and relevant data standards.”

3. Decision

    Definition: The specific choice or action the DSQ informs.
    Why Keep It?
        Aligns each DSQ with an explicit decision-making process (“What will we do with the answer?”).
        Prevents the ontology from collecting data “just in case” by tying each DSQ to a tangible operational or business decision.
    Potential Overlap?
        Some teams bury the Decision in the DSQ text; e.g., “Which engines should we ground for inspection?” implicitly references a Decision.
        A standalone Decision column is helpful if your organization must trace DSQs to an approval or risk mitigation process.

Example

    Decision: “Determine which engines must be grounded for immediate inspection vs. which can remain in operation.”

Do We Need All Three?

    Keep Objectives if you want to show why a DSQ exists in the broader mission or strategy (e.g., cost reduction, improving on-time performance).
    Keep Competency if you need to highlight who or what expertise is required to interpret and implement the DSQ results (common in specialized engineering or regulated environments).
    Keep Decision if the DSQ directly leads to an action or choice that must be documented for traceability or accountability (especially in corporate or safety-critical contexts).

In many simplified templates, Objectives, Competency, and Decision are merged or partially omitted. The key is:

    Objectives keep the “Why?” front and center.
    Competency addresses “Who/What knowledge is needed?”
    Decision highlights “What is the actual outcome or choice?”

If your DSQs are purely “competency questions” for an ontology (e.g., the classical “Does the ontology represent X?”), you might not need separate “Objectives” or “Decision.” Conversely, if you are building a decision-support ontology with real operational stakes, each column provides clarity that is valuable for stakeholders and domain experts.
