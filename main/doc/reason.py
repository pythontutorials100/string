Stakeholder Segmentation for Ontology & DSQ Development
Overview

Selecting the right stakeholder group (sometimes called your “beachhead” use case) is critical. If you try to satisfy everyone at once, your ontology risks becoming unfocused and failing to provide real decision support. Stakeholder segmentation helps you:

    Brainstorm all possible stakeholders (even “longshot” ideas).
    Narrow down to a small number of promising stakeholder segments.
    Conduct primary research to confirm the best “beachhead” group for your initial DSQs.

Step 1A: Brainstorm

    List potential stakeholders who might benefit from your ontology/knowledge graph. These could be maintenance crews, regulatory bodies, suppliers, flight operators, or even end users on the shop floor—anyone who needs decisions informed by your data.

    Don’t filter yet—include unlikely or seemingly “crazy” segments. Sometimes real innovation emerges from exploring unconventional stakeholders or applications.

    Tap into real-life feedback:
        Attend internal or external events, trade shows, or department briefings.
        Talk to domain experts who interact with your data or processes.
        If your team includes an “insider” stakeholder, draw on that direct experience.

    Focus on end-users of the ontology—those who will actually use the decision support. “Stakeholder” often implies an entire department or company, but within each group, there can be distinct roles with different information needs.

Example

    High-Level Idea: “We want to create a knowledge graph that tracks aircraft maintenance events in real-time.”
    Potential Stakeholder Brainstorm:
        Maintenance supervisors
        Inventory managers
        Flight operations planners
        Regulatory compliance officers
        Data analytics teams
        Executive leadership in charge of cost and reliability

Even if you have a specific stakeholder in mind (e.g., “maintenance crew”), expand out to see if others might have more urgent or simpler adoption pathways.
Step 1B: Narrow

Once you have a large list of potential stakeholders and use cases, narrow down to 6–12 particularly interesting or viable segments. This ensures you can devote enough time to explore each segment properly.

Here are seven criteria (adapted from Geoffrey Moore’s framework) to evaluate each potential stakeholder segment:

    Resources: Does the stakeholder have the support, budget, or mandate to adopt the ontology?
    Accessibility: Can you work directly with them (i.e., gain access to their workflows, data, or staff)?
    Compelling Need: Are they genuinely motivated to solve this problem (or are they mostly indifferent)?
    Delivering the Whole “Solution”: Can you or your partners provide the entire data pipeline or knowledge needed for the use case?
    Existing Solutions: Does entrenched competition or an existing system make it hard for them to switch?
    Future Scaling: If you succeed with this stakeholder, can you expand to related groups (e.g., a “bowling pin” effect)?
    Values & Goals: Does the use case align with your ontology team’s mission, technology focus, or strategic objectives?

Example

    Maintenance Supervisors
        Resources: They typically have a budget for new tools if it reduces downtime.
        Accessibility: Easy to engage; they’re on-site and already collecting data.
        Compelling Need: Very high—unscheduled maintenance is costly.
        Whole “Solution”: Must integrate part inventory data, repair logs, and flight schedules.
        Existing Solutions: They might be using a legacy MRO (Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul) platform.
        Future Scaling: If we succeed with one maintenance team, we can replicate across more sites.
        Goals: Aligns with the engineering and cost-reduction aims of the overall company.

Step 1C: Primary Research

Direct conversations and observations with your short-listed stakeholder groups are indispensable. The ontology you build should address real data and decision-making workflows.

    Inquiry, Not Advocacy: Don’t “sell” them on your DSQ. Listen to their pain points, watch them use current tools, and note their day-to-day frustrations.
    Observe Actual Behavior: Ask permission to see how they record maintenance logs or track performance metrics. People’s actions often reveal more than their words.
    Stakeholder Focus: Double-check you have the right stakeholder. Sometimes your “target user” differs from the one who decides on or approves new solutions.
    Look for Patterns: Combine your research into a matrix comparing each stakeholder segment’s needs, constraints, and potential for success.

Example
Stakeholder	Pain Points	Benefits Sought	Key Data Needed	Integration Challenges
Maintenance Crew	Unplanned downtime, slow logs	Faster, clearer updates	Engine health telemetry	Legacy system integration
Inventory Manager	Excess spares or shortages	Optimized inventory cost	Real-time usage forecasts	Linking supply chain data
Flight Operations	Flight delays, scheduling	On-time performance	Maintenance scheduling	Coordinating multiple data sources
Tying It to DSQ Development

Once you have identified your top stakeholder (your “beachhead”), you can craft Decision Support Questions that align with their needs:

    Focus on Relevance
        A DSQ like, “Which aircraft have impending maintenance issues based on abnormal sensor readings?” is directly relevant to Maintenance Supervisors.

    Define Clear Scope
        If the stakeholder is the Maintenance Supervisor, ensure your DSQs revolve around their daily decisions—scheduling repairs, prioritizing parts, or diagnosing system issues.

    Ensure Data Availability
        Confirm the stakeholder’s data is accessible and accurate so the ontology can realistically answer the DSQ.

By approaching stakeholder segmentation systematically, you avoid building an ontology that tries to do everything for everyone and ends up satisfying no one. Instead, you’ll develop DSQs with high impact for the best-fit stakeholder.
Final Thoughts

    Start Broad: Brainstorm all possible stakeholders (including “crazy” ideas).
    Narrow Strategically: Use criteria like resources, accessibility, compelling need, and alignment with your team’s goals.
    Validate in the Field: Conduct interviews or direct observations to confirm real needs.
    Craft Targeted DSQs: Align each question with a stakeholder’s most pressing decisions.

This approach will help you select a high-value use case (or sub-use case) and design DSQs that truly support decision-making through your ontology and knowledge graph.
