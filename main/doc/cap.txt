Slide 9: Benefits & Use Cases

Key bullet points:

    Semantic Integration: Single knowledge graph merges local CSV + JSON data.

    Rich Queries: SPARQL queries can filter defects by edge, by depth, by region, or by blend parameters.

    Ontological Rigor: Data is consistent with BFO/CCO structure, facilitating alignment with broader enterprise knowledge or external ontologies.

Speaking notes:

    Could show a SPARQL query example or mention real analytics.

    Potential for linking to other domain ontologies or data.

Slide 10: Challenges & Lessons Learned

Key bullet points:

    Data Quality: CSV and JSON might not always line up (e.g., missing defects, mismatch in keys).

    Handling BOM: In CSV files with “\ufeffnumber” headers.

    Ontology Scope: Deciding boundaries—what belongs in BFO vs. domain-specific additions.

    Performance: Merging large data sets and generating many triples.

Speaking notes:

    Encourage using encoding="utf-8-sig" if CSV has BOM issues.

    Emphasize iterative development: Start small, scale up.

Slide 11: Next Steps

Key bullet points:

    Extend Ontology: Add new classes/properties if we have new domain needs (e.g., additional defect types).

    Integration: Possibly link to other enterprise data sources or reference ontologies (e.g., QUDT for units).

    Visualization: Tools for graph exploration, reporting, dashboards.

    Continuous Ingestion: Automate frequent refreshes from CSV/JSON as new defect or blend data arrives.

Speaking notes:

    Summarize future improvements or expansions.

Slide 12: Q&A / Thank You

Close with:

    A succinct summary: “We take the best of CSV/JSON data collection and combine it with BFO/CCO-based semantics to produce a robust, queryable knowledge graph.”
