BFO: Continuant vs. Occurrent

Speaker Notes / Script:

    Introduction to BFO
    “BFO, the Basic Formal Ontology, is widely used as a top-level or upper ontology. One of its key insights is dividing all entities into Continuants and Occurrents. Let’s explore what that means.”

1. Continuant

        “A Continuant is something that persists through time while potentially undergoing changes in its qualities or relationships. Think of it as an entity that exists in full at any moment you look at it. It doesn’t ‘unfold’ over time; rather, it endures through time.”

    “Within Continuants, we have several categories:”

        Material Entities:

            “These are physical, tangible objects—for instance, an aircraft component, a rocket engine, or a wrench.”

        Immaterial Sites:

            “Things like a hole, a boundary, or an empty region of space. They exist, but they’re not made of physical matter.”

        Points in Space or Boundaries:

            “Examples include the surface boundary of a wing or a particular coordinate in space.”

        Physical Qualities:

            “Properties like mass, shape, length, or color that characterize a physical entity.”

        Dispositions:

            “Capabilities or tendencies an entity has—like a battery’s capacity to hold charge, or a rocket engine’s ability to produce thrust.”

        Functions:

            “The intended role or purpose of a component—e.g., a turbine’s function to spin and produce mechanical power.”

    “All of these are considered Continuants because they’re the ‘things’ that exist at each snapshot in time, even if their states or properties might evolve.”

2. Occurrent

    “An Occurrent is an entity that unfolds over time—a process, event, or action that has a start, a progression, and an end.”

    “Examples of Occurrents include:”

        Processes:

            “Such as a rocket test firing, an aircraft’s flight from takeoff to landing, or a maintenance procedure.”

        Actions:

            “These are specialized processes often involving an agent’s intentional action—for instance, a mechanic repairing a turbine.”

        Process Boundaries:

            “The exact moment a process starts or ends—like the moment an engine test begins, or when it’s concluded.”

        Temporal Intervals:

            “A span of time during which something occurs—like the flight duration from T=0 to T=3 hours.”

    “So Occurrents are time-bound phenomena—you can’t point to all of it at any single moment, because part of it is in the past, part of it’s happening right now, and part is in the future.”

3. Why This Distinction Matters

    “Understanding Continuant vs. Occurrent is crucial because it shapes how we model things in our ontology. We recognize if we’re talking about a thing (like a rocket engine) that endures through time or an event (like a test firing) that happens through time. This distinction helps keep our ontology consistent, clarifies constraints, and supports more accurate data integration and reasoning.”

Closing / Summary:

    “In short, Continuants are the ‘things’ that exist from moment to moment (objects, properties, functions), while Occurrents are the ‘happenings’ or events that unfold. This fundamental split is one of BFO’s core organizing principles, making it easier to classify real-world aerospace entities—from physical parts to the processes and actions surrounding them.”
