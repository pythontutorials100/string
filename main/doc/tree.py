Hello Casey,

Thank you very much for your email. I am eagerly looking forward to the next steps regarding immigration sponsorship. I have received the O-1 Analysis Chart and Requirements, and I have started gathering information for each criterion. I believe my major focus will be on my publications and my role as a reviewer for major journals. I have also received awards at the local level. Additionally, I can obtain letters from highly recognized individuals in the aerospace and defense sectors from government, industry, and academia.

In the form, I will provide detailed information on the research I have conducted in my field and explain its impact. My objective is to provide this information as early as possible to the team so that I can receive feedback and make any necessary improvements.

Also, thank you for sharing information on the H-1B process. I will prepare to start that process in January.

Best regards,

Shatad Purohit
